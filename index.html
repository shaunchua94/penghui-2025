        Hi Peng Hui, blessed birthday! 
        
        I thank God for your life and for the quiet strength you carry. 
        
        Even though you‚Äôre soft-spoken, I can see that your heart is tender toward Him, 
        and it‚Äôs always such a blessing to hear the glimpses you share about how God 
        is working in your life and family. I pray this year draws you even closer to 
        Him‚Äîthat you continue to know His heart more deeply and walk in His peace and
        joy.
        
        May He bless you abundantly in every way!! ü•≥

        Blessed birthday Pengz! 
        Came a long way since NYP days :" we also known each other for quite 
        long already! I think you have grown ever since to be more outspoken and
        anchored in Christ. Seeing how you journeyed through the difficult times 
        in your life, yet still are still here.
        
        Thank you for being a quiet but strong support ever since you came into 
        this lg. Always can count on you to serve or anchor certain things and I 
        really appreciate it! I'm also glad to see that you try your best to live
        out God's word in your life. Can see that you reflect quite deeply through your sharings, and am encouraged by how you can value add to others' lives as well! Thanks also for coming out of your comfort zone, talking to people, even hosting the project home event, etc. And of course being my shifu in guitar since NYP days hahaha. 
        I'm also glad to see that you are finding a community here despite what 
        you went through in the past. Definitely doesn't come easy to open up and 
        trust others, but I hope that you can continue allowing God to work in your life and others to journey with you! 
        Praying for you that as you turn another year older, you'll gain so much 
        more experience and learnings from God. That you will not be jaded but even more passionate about the things of Christ. That you will have a greater love for the people around you, and yourself too. I pray that you will bear more of the fruit of the Spirit as you journey with Him. And for your relationship with huiru to thrive and grow closer and deeper! Excited to see what God has prepared for you, and I really pray that you will stick close to Him. 
        
        Hang out more over karaoke, beer and guitar soon!!

        blessed birthday peng hui!! 

        it's been a great joy to get to know you better since you joined us in this lg, and in yishun zone :') i think you're one quiet guy, but yet serving in your own ways too. i recall the conversations that we had as i was preparing to go for the musios audition, and how you would encourage me to give my best, and be there for the experience; as well as sharing with me the experience you had. 

        thankyou also for readily opening up your house for the lg ever since you & hui ru shifted in, and for stepping out of your comfort zone much during the recent project home to be an emcee wheee!! your presence is greatly appreciated in the lg! 

        praying that in the year ahead, that you'll continue to see the works of our Heavenly Father in the different areas and aspects of your life, and be reminded of his goodness always :'))

        to have you there brother. 

        Thanks for always opening up your house to the lg and serving us. The 
        prep must‚Äôve been crazy both before and after hosting us.

        Thanks also for waking up super early to faithfully serve the church, 
        confirm damn shag in the morning then still need serve both service. Good job! Still very impressed you can play the guitar without looking at the chords bro!!

        Happy birthday man,

        Finally have another guitarist in the LG, now I can relax one corner. Ok kidding, but can see you enjoy playing the guitar and are stewarding God's gift well.

        Also see how you stepped out of your comfort zone to host for project home, and plan and organise the movies. I know not directly related to ministry but I think it does show how you take initiative. 

        Glad to have you in the LG, and looking forward to getting to know you better.

        Happy birthday!

        Yours in Christ,
        Shaun

        Hello Brother Huiiii 

        Happiest 30th Birthday! Welcome to the old people club. 

        I‚Äôll never forget that legendary moment at the NTP food court‚Äîjust you, me, and the painfully awkward silence‚Ä¶ until I decided to bless your peace by talking to you HAHAHA I‚Äôm so glad we‚Äôre much closer now, without awkward silences (and that frogs will forever remind you of me). Thank you for always checking in on me, and for the care you and Hui Ru have shown to me. Really really blessed by the thoughtfulness of you both :‚Äô) 

        Thanks for being yourself the quiet strength in LG, beer supplier and er dishwasher sometimes. Hahahaha. May you have abundance of blessing and joy this season and forth!!

        Happy birthday Peng Hui! You've been an awesome addition to the LG and I'm really glad to get to know you the past couple of months. You're a sweet guy that's really kind and considerate of other people, and it shows in how you care for the LG and open up your home.

        Praying that you have a wonderful birthday and that the coming year will bring more joy and excitement to your married life. May God fill you with His overwhelming joy!

        Romans 15:13 NIV 
        May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

        may be quiet but your words pack a punch hahah. As you grow a year
